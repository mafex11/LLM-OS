# 🧪 Quick Test Guide - Intelligent Assistant

## 🚀 How to Test Your New Intelligent Assistant

### **Start the Agent**:
```bash
python main.py
```

---

## ✅ Test Cases

### **1. Simple Math (Should Answer Instantly)**
```
You: What's 2+2?
Expected: "4" (no calculator opened)

You: Calculate 25 * 17
Expected: "425" (no calculator opened)

You: What's 100 divided by 4?
Expected: "25" (no calculator opened)
```

**❌ Before**: Opened calculator, clicked numbers (15-20 seconds)
**✅ After**: Instant answer (1-2 seconds)

---

### **2. Factual Questions (Should Answer Directly)**
```
You: Who was Obama?
Expected: Direct answer with his knowledge, then offer to search more

You: What is Python?
Expected: Explanation of Python, then ask if they want more details

You: Explain artificial intelligence
Expected: Direct explanation, no browser opened
```

**❌ Before**: Opened Chrome, searched Google (20-30 seconds)
**✅ After**: Direct answer (2-3 seconds)

---

### **3. Conversational Queries (Natural Responses)**
```
You: Hello!
Expected: Friendly greeting, no tools used

You: How are you?
Expected: Conversational response

You: What can you do?
Expected: Explain capabilities naturally
```

**✅ After**: Natural, friendly responses

---

### **4. Hybrid Queries (Offer Alternatives)**
```
You: Tell me about Obama
Expected: Answers with knowledge first, then asks: 
"Would you like me to search for more details?"

You: Go to Chrome and look for Obama's history
Expected: Offers: "I can tell you about Obama without opening Chrome. 
He was the 44th president... Would you like me to tell you, or 
would you prefer I open Chrome and search?"
```

**✅ New Behavior**: Intelligent alternative offering

---

### **5. Explicit Actions (Should Still Work)**
```
You: Open Chrome
Expected: Opens Chrome (tool used as requested)

You: Launch calculator
Expected: Launches calculator

You: Open Chrome and search for Obama
Expected: Opens Chrome and performs search
```

**✅ Still Works**: Respects explicit tool requests

---

## 📊 What to Look For

### **Good Signs** ✅:
- Math questions answered instantly
- Factual questions answered without opening browser
- Conversational and natural tone
- Offers alternatives intelligently
- Still opens apps when explicitly requested

### **Issues to Watch** ⚠️:
- If it still opens calculator for simple math → Prompt needs adjustment
- If it doesn't open apps when requested → Check query wording
- If responses are too robotic → Conversational tone needs tuning

## 🎯 Example Success Scenario

```
You: Hello! What's 2+2?

Agent: Hello! The answer is 4. Is there anything else I can help you with?
✅ No calculator opened
✅ Instant response
✅ Conversational tone

You: Who was Obama?

Agent: Barack Obama was the 44th President of the United States, 
serving from 2009 to 2017. He was the first African American president 
and a member of the Democratic Party. Before his presidency, he served 
as a U.S. Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008.

Would you like me to search for more detailed information about 
his presidency or specific aspects of his history?
✅ Direct knowledge answer
✅ No browser opened
✅ Offers alternative if needed

You: Open Chrome

Agent: [Opens Chrome]
✅ Respects explicit request
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If agent still opens calculator for math**:
- The LLM might not be recognizing the intelligence-first prompt
- Try more explicit math questions: "What is 5 plus 7?"

### **If agent doesn't offer alternatives**:
- This is working as designed for pure questions
- Alternatives are offered for hybrid queries like "Tell me about X"

### **If agent is too chatty**:
- This is expected - it's now more conversational
- You can adjust tone in system prompt if needed
