2025-10-09 23:44:08 | INFO | EVALUATE: Success. The agent waited for 2 seconds after typing in the search query. The Downloads folder is now in focus, and the search results are displayed.

2025-10-09 23:44:17 | INFO | EVALUATE: Failure. The previous action resulted in double-clicking on "Date modified" instead of the desired file. This is likely due to incorrect coordinates. The foreground app is also incorrect, showing WhatsApp instead of the file explorer.
2025-10-09 23:44:17 | INFO | PLAN: 1. Ensure the Downloads folder is the foreground app.
2. Locate the "Beck g p g" file in the search results.
3. Double-click the "Beck g p g" file to open it.
2025-10-09 23:44:17 | INFO | THOUGHT: The previous attempt failed because the click coordinates were incorrect, and the foreground app was not properly identified.

2025-10-09 23:44:31 | INFO | EVALUATE: Failure. Although the agent switched to "Beck g p g - Search Results in Downloads - File Explorer", the foreground app is now "cancers-16-04230.pdf ‎- Drawboard PDF". This indicates that the switch was not successful, or another application immediately took focus. The plan needs to be adjusted to ensure the correct window is in focus before proceeding.
2025-10-09 23:44:31 | INFO | PLAN: 1. Ensure the Downloads folder is the foreground app: "Beck g p g - Search Results in Downloads - File Explorer".
2. If the Downloads folder is not in focus, switch to it.
3. Locate the "Beck g p g" file in the search results.
4. Double-click the "Beck g p g" file to open it.
2025-10-09 23:44:31 | INFO | THOUGHT: The previous attempt failed because the focus shifted away from the Downloads folder after switching to it. I need to re-verify that the Downloads folder is indeed the foreground app before attempting to double-click the file. If it's not, I'll switch to it again.
