2025-10-12 23:17:03 | INFO | PLAN: I will refine the PowerShell command to filter the list of processes and only show the names of applications that are likely to be user-installed. I will use a combination of techniques, such as excluding processes with specific names or those located in system directories. After that, I will respond to the user with the filtered list.

2025-10-12 23:17:09 | INFO | EVALUATE: Failure. The output still contains many system processes and is not effectively filtered. The previous filter was too broad and didn't exclude enough system processes. I need to refine the PowerShell command to be more specific in excluding system processes.
2025-10-12 23:17:09 | INFO | PLAN: I will try a different approach to filter the processes. Instead of excluding based on the path, I will exclude based on the company name associated with the process. This should be a more reliable way to identify system processes. I will first get the list of processes and their company names, then filter out the ones with Microsoft as the company. After that, I will respond to the user with the filtered list.
2025-10-12 23:17:09 | INFO | THOUGHT: The previous attempt was not effective. I will try filtering based on the company name associated with the process, excluding those from Microsoft. I will use the 'Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Company -notlike "Microsoft*" } | Select-Object Name' command. If this doesn't work, I will ask the user for assistance.

I will try filtering based on the company name associated with the process, excluding those from Microsoft. I will use the 'Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Company -notlike "Microsoft*" } | Select-Object Name' command. If this doesn't work, I will ask the user for assistance.[0m

2025-10-12 23:17:14 | INFO | EVALUATE: Failure. The output still contains a lot of processes that are not user-installed applications. It seems filtering by process name is not effective enough. I need to find a more reliable way to distinguish between system processes and user applications.
2025-10-12 23:17:14 | INFO | PLAN: I will try to combine the previous filtering methods, excluding processes based on both their path and process name. This might provide a more accurate list of user-installed applications. If this still doesn't work, I will ask the user for guidance.
2025-10-12 23:17:14 | INFO | THOUGHT: The previous attempts have not been successful in providing a clean list of user applications. I will combine the path and process name filtering to try and get a better result. I will use the command 'Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Path -notlike "C:\\Windows\\*" -and $_.Path -notlike "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\WindowsApps\\*" -and $_.ProcessName -notlike "*Microsoft*" } | Select-Object Name'. If this fails, I will ask the user for help.
