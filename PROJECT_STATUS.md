**Last Updated**: January 11, 2025  
**Status**: Desktop App Build System Complete + Modern SaaS Frontend + Real-Time Voice Integration + Trigger Word Detection + Voice Crash Fixes ✅

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### Trigger Word Detection System (NEW - Dec 19, 2024)

Implemented "yuki" trigger word functionality for voice control:

#### 1. STT Service Enhancement (`windows_use/agent/stt_service.py`)
- **Trigger Word Detection**: Added "yuki" trigger word detection to STT service
- **Command Extraction**: Extracts commands after trigger word (e.g., "yuki, open my calendar")
- **Waiting State**: Supports saying "yuki" alone, then command in next utterance
- **Speech Filtering**: Only processes speech that contains the trigger word
- **State Management**: Tracks trigger word detection and waiting states

#### 2. Main.py Integration (`main.py`)
- **Voice Mode Enhancement**: Updated `run_voice_mode()` to use trigger word detection
- **User Instructions**: Updated help text to explain trigger word usage
- **Status Indicators**: Shows when waiting for command after trigger word detection
- **Callback Handling**: Modified transcription callback to handle trigger word filtering

#### 3. API Server Integration (`api_server.py`)
- **Voice API Enhancement**: Updated voice mode API to use trigger word detection
- **Transcription Callback**: Modified to handle trigger word filtering
- **Service Initialization**: STT service initialized with trigger word parameter

#### 4. Frontend Integration (`frontend/src/app/chat/page.tsx`)
- **Voice Instructions Panel**: Added animated instructions panel showing "yuki" trigger word usage
- **Toast Notifications**: Updated to include trigger word instructions when voice mode starts
- **UI Updates**: Modified listening status text to show trigger word requirement
- **User Experience**: Added collapsible help panel with examples and dismissible instructions

#### 5. Usage Examples
- **Single Utterance**: "yuki, open my calendar" → processes "open my calendar"
- **Two-Part**: "yuki" (wait) → "open my calendar" → processes "open my calendar"
- **Ignored Speech**: "open my calendar" (without trigger word) → ignored
- **Mixed Speech**: "hello yuki open notepad" → processes "open notepad"

### Backend Voice Integration (Dec 19, 2024)

Connected frontend to existing backend voice system from main.py:

#### 1. Backend STT/TTS Integration
- **Deepgram STT**: Uses existing Deepgram speech recognition from main.py
- **ElevenLabs TTS**: Uses existing ElevenLabs text-to-speech from main.py
- **Auto-send Queries**: Automatically sends queries after speech pause (like main.py)
- **Continuous Listening**: Accumulates speech and sends after 1.5 second pause
- **Real-time Feedback**: Shows interim results in input field while speaking

#### 2. Voice Mode API Endpoints
- **POST /api/voice/start**: Starts voice mode using backend STT/TTS
- **POST /api/voice/stop**: Stops voice mode and STT listening
- **GET /api/voice/status**: Returns current voice mode status
- **Status Polling**: Frontend polls backend every second for status updates
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for API key and service issues

#### 3. Frontend Voice UI
- **Smart Button States**: 
  - Red pulsing when listening (from backend)
  - Blue pulsing when speaking (from backend)
  - White when voice mode off
- **Toast Notifications**: User-friendly status messages
- **API Key Validation**: Checks for Google API key before starting voice mode
- **Real-time Status**: Updates button states based on backend voice status

#### 4. Technical Implementation
- **Backend Integration**: Uses existing run_voice_mode function from main.py
- **Threading**: Voice mode runs in separate thread to avoid blocking API
- **Status Synchronization**: Frontend polls backend for real-time voice state
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallbacks when voice services unavailable
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of voice resources

   - **Performance**: Improved component structure for better React reconciliation and rendering

### Files Modified (Dec 19, 2024 - Text Reveal Animation Fix)
6. `frontend/src/app/chat/page.tsx` - Fixed text reveal animation to only trigger during response generation
   - **Issue**: TextGenerateEffect animation was triggering when switching between different chats from history
   - **Solution**: Added message ID tracking system to distinguish newly generated vs existing messages
   - **Implementation**: 
     - Added `newlyGeneratedMessageIds` state to track which messages should animate
     - Modified Message interface to include optional `id` field
     - Generate unique IDs for all new messages (user, assistant, error)
     - Mark newly generated assistant messages for animation
     - Clear animation state when switching between chats
     - Use TextGenerateEffect only for newly generated messages
     - Use regular text rendering for existing messages when switching chats

   - **Root Cause**: Sessions were only loaded when first message was sent, not on page load
   - **Solution**: Completely restructured chat initialization and storage logic
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Proper Initialization**: Load existing sessions from localStorage on page mount, not just when sending first message
     - **Session Merging**: Fixed logic to properly merge existing sessions with new chat instead of overwriting
     - **Storage Helper**: Added `saveSessionsToStorage()` helper function for consistent localStorage operations
     - **State Management**: Improved session state management to ensure all chats are properly loaded and displayed

### Files Modified (Dec 19, 2024 - Empty Chat Storage Prevention)
8. `frontend/src/app/chat/page.tsx` - Prevented empty chat sessions from being stored in localStorage
   - **Issue**: New empty chat sessions were being created and stored on every page refresh, even if user never started a conversation
   - **Solution**: Modified storage logic to only save chat sessions that contain actual messages
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Smart Filtering**: Updated `saveSessionsToStorage()` to filter out sessions with no messages before saving
     - **Conditional Storage**: Modified localStorage useEffect to check if any sessions have messages before saving
     - **Cleanup Logic**: Added logic to remove localStorage data when no sessions have messages
     - **Storage Optimization**: Prevents localStorage bloat from empty sessions
   - **Result**: Empty chat sessions are no longer stored in localStorage, only conversations with actual messages are persisted

## 💡 Architecture Decisions

### Why Electron?
- Cross-platform potential (though Windows-focused now)
- Modern UI framework (leverages existing Next.js frontend)
- Good developer experience
- Built-in auto-update support

### Why PyInstaller?
- Creates standalone Python executables
- No Python installation required
- Bundles all dependencies
- Wide compatibility

### Why NSIS?
- Professional Windows installers
- Customizable install flow
- Small overhead
- Industry standard

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **API Keys**: Stored locally in `.env`, never transmitted
2. **Code Signing**: Recommended for production (not implemented yet)
3. **Terms Acceptance**: Required before first use
4. **Sandboxed Rendering**: Electron context isolation enabled
5. **No Node Integration**: Security best practices followed

## 📊 Build Artifacts

### Backend Executable
- **File**: `api_server.exe`
- **Size**: ~300-500 MB
- **Contains**: Python runtime + all dependencies

### Frontend Build
- **Directory**: `frontend-build/`
- **Size**: ~50-100 MB
- **Type**: Static Next.js export

### Final Installer
- **File**: `Windows-Use AI Setup 1.0.0.exe`
- **Size**: ~500-800 MB
- **Type**: NSIS installer
