# Voice Mode Fixes - January 15, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Microphone Permission Problem
- **Problem**: Chrome browser was not asking for microphone permissions
- **Root Cause**: The original implementation tried to access microphone directly from Python backend, but web browsers require frontend permission first
- **Solution**: Implemented proper web-based voice recording using MediaRecorder API

### 2. Voice Recording Implementation
- **Added**: New `use-voice.ts` hook for browser-based voice recording
- **Features**:
  - Proper microphone permission handling
  - Audio recording using MediaRecorder API
  - Base64 audio encoding for backend transmission
  - Error handling for unsupported browsers
  - Automatic transcription via Deepgram API

### 3. Backend Transcription Endpoint
- **Added**: `/api/voice/transcribe` endpoint in `api_server.py`
- **Features**:
  - Accepts base64-encoded audio data
  - Uses Deepgram SDK for speech-to-text
  - Proper error handling and response formatting

### 4. Frontend Integration
- **Updated**: Chat page to use new voice recording system
- **Changes**:
  - Removed old backend voice polling logic
  - Integrated new voice hook
  - Updated voice button functionality
  - Improved error messages and user feedback

## Technical Details

### Voice Recording Flow
1. User clicks voice button or presses Ctrl+Shift+V
2. Browser requests microphone permission (if not already granted)
3. MediaRecorder starts capturing audio
4. Audio is recorded in chunks and converted to base64
5. Audio data is sent to `/api/voice/transcribe` endpoint
6. Backend transcribes using Deepgram API
7. Transcript is returned and processed as user input
8. Message is automatically sent to chat

### Dependencies
- **Frontend**: Uses native MediaRecorder API (supported in modern browsers)
- **Backend**: Requires `deepgram-sdk` package (already installed)
- **API Keys**: DEEPGRAM_API_KEY must be set in .env file

### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Chromium
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari (with limitations)
- ❌ Internet Explorer (not supported)

## Testing Instructions

1. Ensure API server is running: `python api_server.py`
2. Ensure .env file contains valid DEEPGRAM_API_KEY
3. Open frontend in Chrome/Firefox
4. Click voice button or press Ctrl+Shift+V
5. Allow microphone permission when prompted
6. Speak a command
7. Verify transcript appears in input field and is sent automatically

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/hooks/use-voice.ts` (new file)
- `frontend/src/app/chat/page.tsx` (updated voice functionality)
- `api_server.py` (added transcription endpoint)
- `.env` (created with API keys)

## Next Steps

- Test voice functionality in different browsers
- Add voice activity detection for better UX
- Implement continuous listening mode
- Add voice command shortcuts
- Improve error handling for network issues
